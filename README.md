# OSU-CS492-400-W2020-Project5
Programming assignment for Oregon State University's CS492 (Mobile Software Development) course which I took in Winter 2020. 
(This one is designated as a portfolio assignment.) 

This is the 2-connection client-server network application for a simple file transfer system, written in C and Python. 

Note: This program was originally written to compile and run on the school's machines/servers.
