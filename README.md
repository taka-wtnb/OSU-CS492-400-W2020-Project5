# OSU-CS492-400-W2020-Project5
Programming assignment for Oregon State University's CS492 (Mobile Software Development) course which I took in Winter 2020. 
(This one is designated as a portfolio assignment.) 

This program is written in Dart using Flutter SDK. This mobile application is called "Wasteagram", which allows users to upload photos and their attributes then create a scrollable list. This app is currently deployable to Android.

Note: I will improve and re-organize my codes from time to time.
